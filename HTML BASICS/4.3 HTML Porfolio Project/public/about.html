<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Brandom! You guys can call me Bran and im from the beautiful city of Lima in Peru. I'm graduated from
  system engineer bachelor's degree back in my country and now I;m in canada doing my College post graduate diploma in
  computer programming! .</p>

<p>I used to work as project manager and co-funder of 2 start up companies. Sadly because of covid we had to close but
  that didn't stop me in perfusing my goal to become a full-stack software developer. I join the world of web
  development and people regard me as "Unicorn" because i do everything from scratch .</p>

<p>Back in my country i was into making music, i was a song writter and a drummer in a rock band. I also use to have a
  k-pop cover dance group and be a professional swimmer. Now that im Canada i would love to re-take my hobbies but since
  i enter to the world of programming i feel i can't stop digging up on coding haha </p>

<p>This is just the skeleton of my first portfolio website. I plan to upgrade this and make an awesome website! </p>
